âœ… Autocomplete Working:
The autocomplete functionality in both the Agencias and Agentes tabs is working as expected. Users can now search for agencies and agents by name and receive dynamic, real-time suggestions.

ðŸš§ Next Task â€“ Build Profile Detail Pages with Wireframes:
We need to create dedicated profile detail pages for each agency and agent. These pages should deliver an in-depth view of the profile, including key details and images. Please use Zillow, RateMyAgent, or RankMyAgent as design references.

Requirements:

Profile Detail Pages:

For Agencies:

Agency name

Contact information

Areas/Neighborhoods served

Listings, recent projects, or properties

Agency ratings/testimonials (if applicable)

Uploaded images (e.g., agency logo, photos of the office or projects)

For Agents:

Agent name

Contact details (phone, email, social media)

Neighborhoods served

Listings or recent properties

Agent ratings/testimonials

Profile picture and any additional relevant images

User Interface & Experience:

Use the design patterns from platforms such as Zillow, RateMyAgent, or RankMyAgent as references to deliver a clean, modern, and user-friendly interface.

Ensure the pages are visually appealing and easy to navigate.

Wireframes:
Below are sample wireframes to guide the layout and structure of the profile detail pages.
