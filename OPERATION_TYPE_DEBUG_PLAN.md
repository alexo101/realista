# Operation Type Field Update Delay - Diagnostic Plan

## Problem Description
- "Tipo de operaci√≥n" field doesn't update immediately in neighborhood results
- Database shows correct value but UI shows old value
- Eventually updates after some delay

## Potential Root Causes

### 1. Cache Invalidation Issues
- React Query cache not being invalidated properly
- Browser cache holding stale data
- Server-side caching (if any) not refreshing

### 2. Query Key Mismatches
- Different query keys used for fetching vs invalidating
- Cache segments not properly aligned

### 3. Race Conditions
- Multiple requests updating/fetching simultaneously
- Old requests overwriting new data

### 4. Frontend State Management
- Form state not syncing with server state
- Component not re-rendering after update

## Investigation Steps

### Step 1: Examine Cache Invalidation
- Check PropertyForm mutation success handlers
- Verify all relevant query keys are invalidated
- Look for neighborhood results query keys

### Step 2: Analyze Query Keys Structure
- Review how properties are fetched in neighborhood results
- Check if operation type filtering uses proper keys
- Ensure consistency across components

### Step 3: Check Update API Response
- Verify server returns updated data immediately
- Check if database update is atomic
- Look for any async operations that might delay

### Step 4: Review Neighborhood Results Logic
- Check how properties are filtered by operation type
- Look for any client-side filtering vs server-side
- Verify fresh data is requested after updates

## Files to Investigate
1. `client/src/components/PropertyForm.tsx` - Update mutations
2. `client/src/pages/neighborhood-results.tsx` - Property display
3. `server/routes.ts` - Property update endpoint
4. `server/storage.ts` - Database update methods
